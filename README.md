# Emotion recognition project
Image-based emotion recognition project using from scratch and pre-trained CNN.
## 1.	Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust emotion recognition system. The aim is to construct a model capable of accurately classifying emotions from images, with applications spanning various domains such as human-computer interaction and mental health assessment. To achieve this goal, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were implemented, either from scratch or using pretrained networks.

## 2.	Data
The dataset for the project is the OpenCV Emotion Images dataset from Kaggle. The dataset provides labeled images with emotions, enabling supervised learning.Each image is associated with an emotion label, such as Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise. The dataset contains 32,298 images, allowing for a diverse and comprehensive training and testing process.
